# Othello
Tools that allow you to link M-MACBETH files and GIS data (in the form of a GDB file).

## Usage
Othello has 2 tools.
The first, `Criteria`, allows to transform the values of a criterion thanks to a scale present in a macbeth file.
The second, `Aggregate`, allows you to aggregate all these values in order to calculate an optimization score.
